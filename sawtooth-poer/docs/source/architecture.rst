PBFT Architecture
*****************

The Sawtooth PBFT algorithm is a voting-based consensus algorithm with Byzantine
fault tolerance, which ensures `safety and liveness
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness#Liveness_and_safety>`__.
The network can tolerate a certain number of "bad" nodes. As long as this number
is not exceeded, the network will work properly. In addition, blocks committed
by nodes are final, so there are no forks in the network.

The nodes on the network send many messages to reach consensus, commit blocks,
and maintain a healthy leader node, called a `primary node`. The network
switches to a new primary (called a `view change`) at regular intervals, as well
as when the current primary is faulty.

* The primary node builds and publishes blocks.

* The other nodes (called `secondary nodes`) vote on blocks and the health of
  the leader.

Sawtooth PBFT runs on each node in the network as a `consensus engine`, a
separate process that handles consensus-related functionality and communicates
with the validator through the consensus API.

The following sections describe Sawtooth PBFT architecture:

* :ref:`Network overview <network-overview-label>`: Describes PBFT fault
  tolerance, view changes, sequence numbers, and the information stored
  by each node

* :ref:`Consensus messages <consensus-messages-label>`: Explains consensus
  message structures and message types

* :ref:`Sawtooth PBFT operation <pbft-operation-label>`: Shows how the
  algorithm handles initialization, normal mode (block processing), and view
  changes

.. _network-overview-label:

Network Overview
================

Fault Tolerance
---------------

A PBFT network consists of nodes that are ordered from 0 to `n-1`, where
`n` is the total number of nodes in the network. The
:ref:`on-chain setting <on-chain-settings-label>` ``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members``
lists all PBFT member nodes and determines the node order.

The PBFT algorithm guarantees network `safety
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness#Liveness_and_safety>`__
as long as the number of faulty nodes remains below the required percentage.
The maximum number of faulty nodes that the network can tolerate is determined
by the formula :math:`f = \frac{n - 1}{3}`. In other words, no more than one
third of the nodes (rounded down) can be unreachable or dishonest at any given
time.

For example, a four-node network can tolerate one faulty node. (PBFT requires a
minimum of four nodes in order to maintain Byzantine fault tolerance.)
Increasing the size of the network reduces the likelihood that all
:math:`\frac{n - 1}{3}` nodes would be faulty at the same time.

.. _view-changes-choosing-primary-label:

View Changes: Choosing a New Primary
------------------------------------

A `view` is the period of time that a given node is the primary, so a `view
change` means switching to a different primary node. The next primary is
selected in a round-robin (circular) fashion, according to the order of nodes
listed in the :ref:`on-chain setting <on-chain-settings-label>`
``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members``.

In a four-node network, for example, the first node (node 0) is the primary at
view 0, the second node (node 1) is the primary at view 1, and so on.  When the
network gets to view 4, it will return to node 0 as the primary.

The algorithm uses the formula `p = v mod n` to determine the next
primary. In this formula, `p` is the primary, `v` is the view number, and `n` is
the total number of nodes in the network. For example, if a four-node network is
at view 7, the formula `7 mod 4` determines that node 3 is the primary.

The Sawtooth PBFT algorithm changes the primary at regular intervals, as well as
when the secondary nodes determine that the current primary is faulty.
See :ref:`view-changing-mode-label` for a description of this process.

Sequence Numbers
----------------

In addition to moving through a series of views, the network moves through a
series of `sequence numbers`. In Sawtooth PBFT, a node's sequence number is
the same as the block number of the next block in the chain. For example, a node
that is on sequence number 10 has already committed block 9 and is evaluating
block 10.

Also, each message includes a sequence number that indicates which block the
message is for. For example, a message with sequence number 10 applies to block
number 10.

.. _node-storage-label:

Information Storage
-------------------

Each node stores several key pieces of information as part of its state:

* List of PBFT member nodes in the network (from
  ``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members``)

* Current view number, which identifies the primary node

* Current sequence number, which is also the number of the block being processed

* The current head of the chain

* If in normal mode, the step of the algorithm itâ€™s on
  (see :ref:`normal-mode-label`)

* Log of all blocks it has received

* Log of all messages it has received

.. _network-config-label:

Network Configuration
---------------------

Sawtooth PBFT configures the network with on-chain settings, which are processed
by the `Settings transaction processor
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html>`__ (or an equivalent).

These settings list each node in the network, set the view-change interval (how
often the primary changes), and specify other items such as the block publishing
frequency, timeout periods, and message log size.
For more information, see :doc:`configuring-pbft`.


.. _consensus-messages-label:

Consensus Messages
==================

All PBFT consensus messages are serialized as `protobufs (protocol buffers)
<https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`__.

When a node receives a new consensus message from another node, it parses the
protobuf into a native Rust struct (``ParsedMessage``) that allows for easier
handling of the message. After parsing, the node performs a series of checks to
ensure the validity of the message:

1. The ``signer_id`` of the PBFT message must match the ``signer_id`` of the
   ``PeerMessage`` that contains it.

2. The message must be from a known PBFT member (the ``signer_id`` of the PBFT
   message must be in the ``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members`` list)

The first check verifies that the PBFT message was created and signed by the
node that it claims to be from. The ``PeerMessage``, which acts as a wrapper for
the PBFT message, contains a signature of the PBFT message and a ``signer_id``;
this signature and ID are verified by the validator to ensure that the contents
of the ``PeerMessage`` are legitimate. PBFT then ensures that the ``signer_id``
of the PBFT message matches the one the validator used, which guarantees the
origin of the PBFT message.

The second check ensures that only nodes that are accepted members of the PBFT
network are able to participate in the consensus process.

Any messages that fail to parse or pass the required checks are ignored. If a
message is successfully parsed and passes verification, it is passed to a
handler for that specific message type (see :ref:`pbft-arch-message-types`),
where it may go through further checks, be stored in the message log, or trigger
some actions.


Message Definitions
-------------------

Most Sawtooth PBFT messages use the ``PbftMessage`` protobuf, as shown below.
The ``PbftNewView``, ``PbftSignedVote``, and ``PbftSeal`` protobufs are
structurally different from ``PbftMessage`` and are used for messages that
require different sets of data to be exchanged.

Sawtooth PBFT also uses some of the message types defined in the consensus API,
such as ``BlockNew`` and ``BlockCommit``. These messages are called "updates" to
distinguish them from the PBFT-specific messages. For more information on the
consensus API's ``Update`` messages, see the `Consensus API RFC
<https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/blob/master/text/0004-consensus-api.md#updates>`__.

.. code-block:: protobuf

    // Represents all common information used in a PBFT message
    message PbftMessageInfo {
      // Type of the message
      string msg_type = 1;

      // View number
      uint64 view = 2;

      // Sequence number

    }

.. _pbft-arch-message-types:

Message Types
-------------

A Sawtooth PBFT message has one of the following types:

* ``PrePrepare``: Sent by the primary node after it has published a new block

* ``Prepare``: Broadcast by every node in the ``Preparing`` phase

* ``Commit``: Broadcast by every node in the ``Committing`` phase

* ``ViewChange``: Sent by any node that suspects that the primary is faulty

* ``NewView``: Sent by the node that will be the new primary to complete a view
  change

* ``Seal``: Proves that a block was committed after ``2f + 1`` nodes agreed to
  commit it

* ``SealRequest``: Sent by a node that is requesting a consensus seal for the
  block that was committed at a given sequence number


.. _pbft-operation-label:

PBFT Operation
==============

The Sawtooth PBFT algorithm starts with initialization, then operates in one of
two modes:

* :ref:`Normal mode <normal-mode-label>` for processing blocks

* :ref:`View Changing mode <view-changing-mode-label>` for switching to a
  different primary node

.. note::

   The original PBFT definition includes a checkpointing procedure that is
   responsible for garbage collection of the log. Sawtooth PBFT does not
   implement this checkpointing procedure; instead, it cleans the log
   periodically during its normal operation. For more information, see
   :ref:`log-pruning-label`.


Initialization
--------------

When the Sawtooth PBFT consensus engine starts, it does the following:

* Loads its configuration

* Initializes its state and message log

* Establishes timers and counters


.. _normal-mode-label:

Normal Mode
-----------

In Normal mode, nodes check blocks and approve them to be committed to the
blockchain. The Sawtooth PBFT algorithm usually operates in normal mode unless a
:ref:`view change <view-changing-mode-label>` is necessary.


Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

The normal mode proceeds as follows:

1. All nodes begin in the ``PrePreparing`` phase; the purpose of this phase is
   for the primary to publish a new block and endorse the block with a
   ``PrePrepare`` message.

   - The primary node will send a request to its validator to initialize a new
     block. After a configurable timeout (determined by the
     ``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.block_publishing_delay`` setting), the primary will send
     a request to the validator to finalize the block and broadcast it to the
     network.

   - After receiving the block in a ``BlockNew`` update and ensuring that the
     block is valid, all nodes will store the block in their PBFT logs.

   - After receiving the ``BlockNew`` update, the primary will broadcast a
     ``PrePrepare`` message for that block to all of the nodes in the network.
     When the nodes receive this ``PrePrepare`` message, they will make sure it
     is valid; if it is, they will add it to their respective logs and move on
     to the ``Preparing`` phase.

#. In the ``Preparing`` phase, all secondary nodes (not the primary) broadcast a
   ``Prepare`` message that matches the accepted ``PrePrepare`` message. Each
   node will then add its own ``Prepare`` to its log, then accept ``Prepare``
   messages from other nodes and add them to its log. Once a node has ``2f + 1``
   ``Prepare`` messages in its log that match the accepted ``PrePrepare``, it
   will move on to the ``Committing`` phase.

#. The ``Committing`` phase is similar to the ``Preparing`` phase; nodes
   broadcast a ``Commit`` message to all nodes in the network, wait until there
   are ``2f + 1`` ``Commit`` messages in their logs, then move on to the
   ``Finishing`` phase. The only major difference between the ``Preparing`` and
   ``Committing`` phases is that in the ``Committing`` phase, the primary node
   is allowed to broadcast a message.

#. Once in the ``Finishing`` phase, each node will tell its validator to commit
   the block for which they have a matching ``PrePrepare``, ``2f + 1``
   ``Prepare`` messages, and ``2f + 1`` ``Commit`` messages. The node will then
   wait for a ``BlockCommit`` notification from its validator to signal that the
   block has been successfully committed to the chain. After receiving this
   confirmation, the node will update its state as follows:

   - Increment its sequence number by 1

   - Update its current chain head to the block that was just committed

   - Reset its phase to ``PrePreparing``

   Finally, the primary node will initialize a new block to start the process
   all over again.

This diagram summarizes the four Normal mode phases, the messages sent, and the
interactions with the validators. N1 is the primary node; N2, N3, and N4 are
secondary nodes.

.. _log-pruning-label:

Log Pruning
^^^^^^^^^^^

Sawtooth PBFT does not implement a checkpointing procedure (garbage collection
of the log). Instead, each node cleans the log periodically during normal
operation.

Log size is controlled on each node with the ``--max_log_size`` option when
starting the PBFT consensus engine (see :ref:`cli-options-label`). When a
block is committed, each node compares the size of its log against the maximum
size. If the log exceeds this value, Sawtooth PBFT uses these rules to prune the
log:

- Keep blocks and messages for the sequence number of the block that was just
  committed, plus those for any higher (newer) sequence numbers

- Delete blocks and messages for all lower (earlier) sequence numbers


.. _view-changing-mode-label:

View Changing Mode
------------------

A `view change` switches to a different primary node. A node starts a new view
change if any of the following occur:

- The `idle timeout` expires - when a node enters the ``PrePreparing`` phase,
  it will start its idle timeout. If the node receives a new block and a
  matching ``PrePrepare`` from the primary for its current sequence number
  before the timeout expires, it will stop the timeout; if not, the node will
  initiate a view change when the timeout expires.

- The `commit timeout` expires - when a node enters the ``Preparing`` phase, it
  will start its commit timeout. If the node is able to move on to the
  ``Finishing`` phase and send a request to the validator to commit the block
  before the timeout expires, it will stop the timeout; if not, the node will
  initiate a view change when the timeout expires.

- The `view change timeout` expires - when a node starts a view change to view
  ``v``, it will start a view change timeout. If the node is able to complete
  the view change before the timeout expires, it will stop the timeout; if not,
  it will initiate a new view change to view ``v + 1``.

- Multiple ``PrePrepare`` messages are received for the same view and sequence
  number but different blocks - this indicates the primary is faulty, since
  this behavior is invalid.

- A ``Prepare`` message is received from the primary - this indicates the
  primary is faulty, since this behavior is invalid.

- ``f + 1`` ``ViewChange`` messages are received for the same view - this
  ensures that a node does not wait too long to start a view change; since only
  ``f`` nodes (at most) can be faulty at any given time, if more than ``f``
  nodes decide to start a view change, other nodes can safely join them to
  perform that view change.

To start a view change, a node will do the following:

1. Update its mode to ``ViewChanging(v)``, where ``v`` is the view the node is
   changing to
#. Stop both the idle and and commit timeouts, since these are not needed again
   until after the view change
#. Stop the view change timeout if it's been started; it will be restarted with a
   new value later
#. Broadcast a ``ViewChange`` message for the new view

``ViewChange`` messages are accepted and added to the log if they satisfy these
criteria:

- They are for a later view than the node's current view

- If the node is in the mode ``ViewChanging(v)``, the view in the message must
  be greater than or equal to ``v``

Once a node has received ``2f + 1`` ``ViewChange`` messages for the new view, it
will start its view change timeout; this timeout ensures that the new primary
starts the new view in a timely manner. The duration of the timeout is
calculated based on a base duration (determined by the
``sawtooth.consensus.pbft.view_change_duration`` setting) using the formula:
:math:`(DesiredViewNumber - CurrentViewNumber) * ViewChangeDuration`.

When the primary for the new view receives ``2f + 1`` ``ViewChange`` messages,
it will broadcast a ``NewView`` message to the network, signifying that the view
change is complete. As a proof that this view change is valid, the primary will
include ``2f + 1`` signed ``ViewChange`` messages from other nodes in the
``NewView`` message (the primary's own "vote" is implicit), which will be
validated by the other nodes.

If a node receives the new primary's valid ``NewView`` message before its view
change timeout expires, it will:

1. Stop the view change timeout

2. Update its view to match the new value

3. Revert back to Normal mode

However, if a node's view change timeout expires before it receives a
``NewView``, it will stop the timeout and initiate a brand new view change for
view ``v + 1`` (where ``v`` is the view it was attempting to change to before).
